# Preprocessing
Preprocessing is the first part of query evaluation. For interested readers, who might ask, why do we need macros, we answer: We don't, but it simplify many things. Mainly:

a) Fast new function definitions - just inject it as text
b) Nested "for" cycles on text level - standard batch processing supports only one level "for" cycle and runs on postsyntactic level, therefore less powerful for some tasks

Macro can be inbuilt, unnamed or named.
