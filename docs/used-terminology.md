# Used terminology
This is the overview of used terminology in this document (LSQL reference documentation).

| Term | Explanation |
| ---  | ----------- |
| Token, Lexical token, Lexem | Substring of a query |
| Tokenization, Lexical analysis | Process of converting input query to tokens. |
| Lexer, Tokenizer | A program, which does lexical analysis. |
| List of tokens | Output of lexical analysis, generated by lexer. Basically list of flat data structures (substrings). |
| Syntactic analysis, Parsing | Making a parse tree out of list of tokens. |
| Syntactic analyzator, Parser | A program, which parses list of tokens. |
| Term | Any element of a parse tree |
| Query, Command | The complete LSQL command, which can be executed. It accepts and returns some data. |
| Block | A basic part of query separated by comma. After a block name keyword there is either arithmetic or expression (depending on type of block). |
| Expression | Term, which is never leaf of a parse tree and is always (in)direct child of block. |
| Table | Flat input data with columns and rows. There can be multiple tables in input, but only one at the output. |
| Input, Input data | Data, on which will be query evaluated on. |
| Output, Output data | Output of query evaluation. |
| Column name | Name of a column inside a Table. Columns can't be nameless and semantics implementations can make autogenerated names for columns. A column can have multiple names.|
| Variable | Leaf term in a parse tree, which represent a user-entered constant or column (by a name). In context of lexical or synactic analysis of batch expression a variable represented by a wildcard may be more variables. |
| Variable type | An inner representation of a variable in memory. A constant have always only one type, but depending on an implementation, a row can have multiple data types. |
| Wildcard | Standard bash wildcard for selection of columns by a name, available only in batch expressions. They are expanded in semantic analysis. |
| Curly expanding | Curly bracket (braces) expansion - similar to bash curly expanding. Part of language preprocessing. Available only in batch expressions. If used in arithmetic expression, which isn't inside other batch expression, preprocessor should return error. |
| Preprocessing | Query altering/expansion before it is passed to the lexer |
| Constant | Type of variable, which will be same no matter what input data will come. |
| Inbuild constant | Type of constant, which should be hardcoded in semantic part of implementation of the language. |
| Function token | Lexical token representing the function without any arguments. |
| Infix function | TODO |
| Prefix function | TODO |
| Scalar | Nonarray variable type |
| Bool | True or False, variable type |
| String | An ordered tuple of chars, variable type |
| Double | A number with floating point, variable type |
| DimensionalDouble | Double with units (like 50 km/h), variable type |
| Array | An ordered tuple of scalars, variable type |
| Int, Integer | An integer, variable type |
| Arithmetic expression | A mode of language. It might be activated by () or activated by default depending on block type. |
| Batch expression | A mode of language. It might be activated by [] or activated by default depending on block type. |
| Identifier | Token identifing eather a function, inbuilt constant or variable. |
| Arithmetic identifier | Identifier lexed in arithmetic expression |
| Batch expression | Identifier lexed in batch expression |
| Statement | Universal word for any nontrivial language lexem or term |
| Macro | Part of query, which will be evaluated by preprocessor. |
| Named macro | Macro with a name defined inside macro block. |
| Unification | Associating two macros, so they are evaluated together. |
| Element (in batch expression) | A part of batch expression separated by whitespace. |
| Lookup quote statement | Statement enclosed in grave accent chars, eg. `\`xyz\`` |
| Constant quote statement | Statement enclosed in single or double quote chars |
