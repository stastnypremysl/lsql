# Functions overview
In the language are all functions 0-ary (futher called only as constants), 1-ary and 2-ary. (1-ary means, that function accepts one variable as input. 2-ary means, that function accepts two variables as input.)

Each function have its unique lexem, which is determined during lexical analysis. Constant tokens can't have another arity then 0-arity, but there are some functions, which may have both 1-arity or 2-arity.
The arity is determined during syntactic analysis.

The evaluation of functions is left to semantic analysis.

## Constants
### Pi
* Pi is simply called as `pi`
* Double

### E
* E is simply called as `e`
* Double

### i
* Imaginary unit
* Called as `i`
* Complex

## Functions
### 1-arity functions
#### Sin
* Standard trigonometric sin function.


#### Cos
* Standard trigonometric cos function.
### 2-arity functions
